    "In the globalized world today, it is exceptionally valuable to have international work experience. Most young adults like myself in Singapore would have considered moving overseas for opportunities to major cities such as Toronto or New York. However, such cities can have a high cost of living. For the purpose of this project, we will be picking New York City to determine its quality of life there should we decide to work there.\n",

    "My target audience will be anyone interested to work in New York City and rent a place there.The information is useful for anyone who wish to work in New York City even though I talked about young adults.\n",

    "There are 2 factors that we should consider for working in New York City. \n",
    "1. The cost of living (essentially average apartment rent in Brooklyn & Manhattan)\n",
